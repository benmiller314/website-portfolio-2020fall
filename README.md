Hello! Welcome to my website! You can find the file to my website in the folder titled "docs". The main page is called "index". 

The point of this website is to provide information on the 1994 Rwandan Genocide through a documentary I made with my team for the 2018 PA National History Day state-level competition. Furthermore, the site aims to serve as an educational tool about genocide in general, and modern countries of concern.

I am a complete beginner with coding, but hopefully you all find my project to be a helpful tool with a good sense of organization and basic aesthetics. Oftentimes, we don't learn about non-Eurocentric events in history so I think it is important to shed light on such a tragic occurrence like the Rwandan Genocide. Furthermore, we must be knowledgable and aware of the genocides that are going on **right now**.
