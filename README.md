Hello! Welcome to my website! For my final unit, I decided to add on a new tab to my website from the last unit. This tab is called "Rwanda", and includes some cool facts, photos, and an interactive Google Map so you can see where the country is! You can find the file to this page in the folder titled "docs". It is called "rwanda.html". 

With this new tab, I was able to experiment with new skills and really experience growth as a beginner coder! I hope this tab is able to provide you with some interesting details that give Rwanda life beyond the genocide.
