Hello! You can find the file to my website in the folder titled "docs", and then inside of that, a folder called "preview 10/27". The main page is called "index". 
My draft for today is **VERY, VERY ROUGH.** 

I am a complete beginner with coding, and so I am pretty slow with figuring out all the kinks of working with html and css. So far, what I have included is my index page, and a navigation menu at the top to direct you to pages which have placeholder content right now. There are a few pictures below the title on the index page, and then feautured below is a documentary I made with my team for the 2018 PA National History Day state-level competition.

The point of this website is to provide information on the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, and showcase our documentary. Furthermore, the site aims to serve as an educational tool about genocide in general, and modern countries of concern. 


**Some obvious issues that I am trying to figure out how to fix so far:** 
-Getting the content in the navigation menu to center

-Getting the pictures on the index page to stay on the same line

-Getting the documentary to be completely centered on the page

-Figure out how to get rid of the weird button between the two on the bottom


**Other things I hope to figure out:**
-Changing the hover color of the content in the navigation bar

-Getting the buttons on the bottom to stay in the same line 

-Adding a gap between the pictures and documentary 

-Making the page more visually appealing overall!

-Figuring out if there's any way to use fonts beyond the basic ones that are web-safe.

**I'd love any tips you have to offer for any of these issues, and all of your critiques in general!**
